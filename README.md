# Household-demand-prediction
Forecast the demand for household energy consumption using historical data using SARIMAX
We try to use ARIMA model to try and predict the energy consumption and compare the performace with SARIMAX model.
Another approcah would be to use Deep Learning models using LSTM/GRU to learn the patterns in data and make predictions.
